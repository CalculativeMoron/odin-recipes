          <p class="makegreen">First we'll need some nice uranium.<br> Make sure to get it from an anonymous<br> channel so the government doesn't<br> suspect a thing.</p>

          <hr class="waste">
            <p class="makegreen">To make sure no one else knows what<br> we're doing, we have to find a place for all<br> of this. Make sure it's isolated from the rest<br> of the world.<br>(Note: You'll need a facility.)</p>

          <hr class="waste">
            <p class="makegreen">Getting the uranium and finding a good<br> location are only a few of the hurdles you'll<br> face, because next you have to make a bomb-<br> an atomic bomb. Good luck!<br>(Note: Also prepare a bomber, you'll need it!)</p>

        <h2 class="uran">Drop</h2>
          <hr class="waste">
            <p class="makegreen">After somehow making the atomic bomb,<br> you'll have to find another location to drop it.<br> Preferably you'll want to drop it close enough<br> to a large, populated country to cause public<br> panic, but far away enough so said country can't<br> defend against it.</p>

          <hr class="waste">
            <p class="makegreen">After finding a place to drop the bomb, just set<br> the bomber in place and send the signal, then hope you<br> don't get caught. Make sure to immedately flee<br> the place where the facility the bomb was made after<br> sendng off the bomber.<br>(Note: You should have a plane/jet or<br> underground railway system on the side.)</p>

          <hr class="waste">
            <p class="makegreen">Assuming no one beside your allies knows you<br> planned the attack, try and fool the goverment to<br> allow you to join in the inspection team. If that<br> doesn't work then you're free to assassinate one<br> of the people who were gonna be in the team and<br> disguise as them.</p>

        <h2 class="uran">Waste</h2>
          <hr class="waste">
            <p class="makegreen">Still assuming, if you succesful make it into the team, than before they set all of you off to the site, set up some kind of storage area in your hazmat suit where you'll hide the nuclear waste. When you reach the site, collect the waste like the other's, but secretly hide them in the suit. After all that, go somewhere safe, store the waste, and let the government handle everything else. Now you have your nuclear waste, what are you gonna do with it? I don't know, but it looks like a cake.</p>
