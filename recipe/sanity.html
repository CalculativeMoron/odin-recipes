        <h2 class="lis">Sleep Less</h2>
          <p class="li">First and foremost- sleep. Sleep is directly<br> tied to the mental state of a being, thus delaying<br> or completely stopping it's sleep could cause<br> various mental damages.</p>

          <h2 class="lis">Eat Less</h2>
            <p class="li">Although eating less could make people more slim<br>, thus making them more healthy if they were<br> previously overweight, eating so little that you just barely<br> meet your bodily needs and forcecing yourself not to eat<br> the foods you like could make you lose your mind.</p>

          <h2 class="lis">Socialize Less</h2>
            <p class="li">Humans are social creatures, so it's practically impossible<br> for even introverts to not enjoy interacting with someone else,<br> whether that be in real life or digital. What this all means is<br> that not talking to anyone for a long period of time can slowly<br> wear down your mental defenses or outright make you go insane.</p>

          <h2 class="lis">Think Less</h2>
            <p class="li">In addition to socializing less, thinking less can also wear down<br> your mental defenses. Thinking is pretty complicated and hard to<br> explain, but it's vital for your mental health. Thinking is like the<br> foundation for your entire mental state, you think when you feel,<br> you think when you learn, you'll be no more than an inanimate<br> object. Without thinking you're practically dead.</p>

          <h2 class="lis">Move Less</h2>
            <p class="li">Humans move everday, from walking to work to scratching their<br> necks. Even when they do something like tapping on their keyboards,<br> they're still moving. Exluding blinking, not moving at all, especially<br> when you're wide awake, would cause you to feel a sudden irresistible,<br> itch, even if you're still for a minute or two, try it. That irresistible</p>

          <h2 class="lis">Feel Less</h2>
            <p class="li">Our every move and thought is driven by how we feel, so strictly<br> speaking, not feeling should be impossible. But is it? You see,<br> boredom is categorized as a feeling, but is also seen as the lack of,<br> any feeling, so we could cancel the latter statement and simply say<br> boredom isn't a feeling.'Feeling' boredom is pretty easy, simply don't<br> do anything that entertains you or makes you feel.</p>

      <li>
        <hr>
          <h2 class="lis">Appear Less</h2>
            <p class="li">Making yourself completely disappear from all walks of life will<br> certainly make you go insane. This isn't simply making yourself<br> interact with people less, this is completely becoming less than<br> a shadow. invisible to all but yourself, recognizing yourself as<br> nothing more than a failure, no one caring about your existence,<br> and locked up in your own mental torment- all that added up plus<br> the previous steps will drive even the strongest wills to collapse.</p>
