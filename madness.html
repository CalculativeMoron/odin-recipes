        <h2>Sway the Public Opinion</h2>
          <hr class="madness">
            <p>Before anything, we need to get the public<br> to join our side, so our actions are taken<br> in good light.</p>
          <hr class="madness">
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>Create Controversy</h2>
          <hr class= "madness">
            <p>Spread false rumors or lies about someone<br> or something, maybe of a political figure<br> and the like. After that? Spread more lies<br> that are even more outragous.<br>(Note: Make sure those controversies<br> actually make sense.)</p>
          <hr class="madness">
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>Create a Group</h2>
          <hr class="madness">
            <p>Try to find yourself some friends, you'll need<br> them later on. You can't? Well, form a gang and<br> recruit some members, voluntary or forcefully,<br> they're joining you.</p>
          <hr class="madness">
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>Get Supplies</h2>
          <hr class="madness">
           <p>Put those friends and gang members to use by<br> getting them to stock up on supplies, priority<br> on ones that don't expire quickly, since not<br> many refrigerators will be functioning after<br> what you're about to do.</p>
          <hr class="madness">
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>Take Initiative</h2>
          <hr class="madness">
           <p>Since people are mostly seeing all the controversies<br> as entertainment rather then something to take<br> serously, start your first campaign. Assuming you've<br> armed yourself during this time, pick up your guns<br> and weapons and begin causing chaos in your local<br> area. Most people would immediately turn to the<br> controversies as an answer to all that going on.</p>
          <hr class="madness">
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>Rinse and Repeat</h2>
          <hr class="madness">
           <p>After the local public starts taking those previous<br> controversies serously, use their anxiety to pressure<br> them into joining you, increasing your team. After<br> getting more people to join you, collect more supplies,<br> since the final step is just around the cprner.</p>
          <hr class="madness">
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>Capture Government Property</h2>
          <hr class="madness">
            <p>Now is time. You have everything you need. You feel<br> ready for the government, so you then charge at a<br> police station and manage to capture it, leaving the<br> local area in even more disarray. The people don't<br> react too much, since most of them are on your side.<br> Now sit back and watch as chaos ensues.</p>
